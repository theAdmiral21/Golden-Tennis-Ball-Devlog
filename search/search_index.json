The game follows Chispa, Lola, and their friends on a cross-country journey to find the Golden Tennis Ball. It draws inspiration from classics like Sonic the Hedgehog 2 as well as modern hits like Celeste and Pizza Tower.  </p> <p></p> <p>The story is born out of the homesickness I felt after moving across the country and showcases the special bond people share with their four-legged friends.</p>"},{"location":"2025/11/18/firstPost/#who-are-chispa-and-lola","title":"Who are Chispa and Lola?","text":"<p>Chispa and Lola are the stars of this game \u2014 they are my dogs, and each has their own unique personality.  </p> Chispa run animation test. <p>Chispa is smart, curious, and friendly. She will be the first to tell you that she has never met a stranger.  </p> Chispa run animation test. <p>Lola is small, snuggly, and shy. While Chispa shines in the limelight, Lola prefers to hide from strangers under the bed. </p>"},{"location":"2025/11/18/firstPost/#history","title":"History","text":"<p>Making a game was one of those moments where I thought, \u201cHow hard could it be?\u201d \u2014 and then promptly found out. Despite years of coding experience, making a game has proven to be the most difficult project I've ever taken on.  </p> <p>In early 2024, I was dabbling in pixel art when I realized I didn\u2019t have a place to show it off. Sure, I could make another mod for Barotrauma, but the dark depths of Europa are no place for little Lola. I had been toying with the idea of making a game for about a year at that point. One morning, my wife and I came up with the story for the Golden Tennis Ball over breakfast and put together a rough draft of the levels. That draft sat on my desk for months. Reading it and looking at my animations of Lola, I decided it was finally time to make The Golden Tennis Ball.  </p> <p>Development began in Python using PyGame. I built my own spawning systems, controls, and even a small intro cutscene that I shared with friends. Progress was slow and frustrating. I had heard the term \u201cGame Engine\u201d but didn\u2019t really know what it meant. Eventually, with development driving me insane, I googled \u201cwhat is a game engine?\u201d \u2014 and immediately both Godot and Unity appeared. They changed everything.  </p> <p>I experimented with both engines, attempting to rebuild the level I had made in PyGame. Ultimately, I chose Unity. It was easier for me to learn, had tons of resources, and allowed me to expand my software skills \u2014 learning C# was an opportunity I couldn\u2019t pass up. From there, I began building the different systems that make up The Golden Tennis Ball.</p> <p>That\u2019s all for now! In the next post, I\u2019ll cover character controller design and the different approaches I\u2019ve taken to build a controller that feels good to use.</p>"}]}
