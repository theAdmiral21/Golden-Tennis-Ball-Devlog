Welcome to the *Quest for the Golden Tennis Ball* devlog! This is the first of many posts detailing the development of *The Quest for the Golden Tennis Ball* (GTB). In this post, I'll talk about what the game is, introduce its stars, Chispa and Lola, and share a little history behind the project.

### What is the Quest for the Golden Tennis Ball?
*The Quest for the Golden Tennis Ball* is a 2D platformer developed in Unity. The game follows Chispa, Lola, and their friends on a cross-country journey to find the Golden Tennis Ball. It draws inspiration from classics like *Sonic the Hedgehog 2* as well as modern hits like *Celeste* and *Pizza Tower*.

The story is born out of the homesickness I felt after moving across the country and showcases the special bond people share with their four-legged friends.

### Who are Chispa and Lola?
Chispa and Lola are the stars of this game — they are my dogs, and each has their own unique personality.

**Chispa** is smart, curious, and friendly. She will be the first to tell you that she has never met a stranger.

**Lola** is small, snuggly, and shy. While Chispa shines in the limelight, Lola prefers to hide from strangers under the bed. 

### History
Making a game was one of those moments where I thought, *“How hard could it be?”* — and then promptly found out. Despite years of coding experience, making a game has proven to be the most difficult project I've ever taken on.  

In early 2024, I was dabbling in pixel art when I realized I didn’t have a place to show it off. Sure, I _could_ make another mod for *Barotrauma*, but the dark depths of Europa are no place for little Lola. I had been toying with the idea of making a game for about a year at that point. One morning, my wife and I came up with the story for the Golden Tennis Ball over breakfast and put together a rough draft of the levels. That draft sat on my desk for months. Reading it and looking at my animations of Lola, I decided it was finally time to make *The Golden Tennis Ball*.  

Development began in Python using PyGame. I built my own spawning systems, controls, and even a small intro cutscene that I shared with friends. Progress was slow and frustrating. I had heard the term *“Game Engine”* but didn’t really know what it meant. Eventually, with development driving me insane, I googled *“what is a game engine?”* — and immediately both Godot and Unity appeared. They changed everything.  

I experimented with both engines, attempting to rebuild the level I had made in PyGame. Ultimately, I chose Unity. It was easier for me to learn, had tons of resources, and allowed me to expand my software skills — learning C# was an opportunity I couldn’t pass up. From there, I began building the different systems that make up *The Golden Tennis Ball*.

That’s all for now! In the next post, I’ll cover **character controller design** and the different approaches I’ve taken to build a controller that feels good to use.
