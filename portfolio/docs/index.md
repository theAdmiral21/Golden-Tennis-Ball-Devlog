<h1> Chispa and Lola: The Quest for the Golden Tennis Ball</h1>

This site is dedicated to hosting the devlog for the Quest for the Golden Tennis Ball. Follow along with me as I learn what it takes to make a game. I plan to cover everything in the development process from the art to the code. I'll even include some Unity specific scripts for the aspiring game dev.  
  
So sit back, relax, and enjoy this journey to make the Quest for the Golden Tennis Ball.
